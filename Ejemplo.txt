I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'? (What's happenin'?)
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin' (clap)
Go pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player (drop it)
Drop, drop it for me (drop it)

I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (nope)
Lobster tail for dinner (yeah)
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it, now
Jump in the Cadillac
Girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want
Just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you
